The first thing you need to do to get the ork toolchain going is to download
the avr toolchain. You can do this by running the following commands in your
terminal (make sure you are in this directory for the later parts):

sudo apt-get install gcc-avr
sudo apt-get install avr-libc
sudo apt-get install avrdude

This will allow you to compile avr-c code and load lit onto avr mcu's with
standard programmers.

The next thing you should do is install the cli_linux bootloader so you can
program the ork through USB. To do this, make it an executable (its in this
directory) then copy it to your bin. Like this:

chmod +x cli_linux
sudo cp cli_linux /usr/bin

That should get you to a point where you can use the makefile to compile and
write the example code to the ork kit by typing:

sudo make program

Make sure that you are in programming mode (jumper on programming header) to
program and run mode to run. Press reset after switching the jumper to swap.
